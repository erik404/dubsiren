Dubsiren for Arduino microcontroller

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dub_siren

On request I've uploaded my Arduino dubsiren code. Note that this is a proof-of-concept of how to build a dubsiren with an Arduino microcontroller. It is unoptimized but can be used to explain the basics of sound-processing with the Arduino. The in/out-put pins used on the microcontroller should be self explanatory when following the code. When using a line-out to a mixingdesk or other device make sure you use appropriate resistance to get the required output voltage. Without resistance the output voltage is 5v.
