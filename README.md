Dubsiren for Arduino microcontroller

On request I've uploaded my Arduino dubsiren code. Note that this is a proof-of-concept of how to build a dubsiren with an Arduino microcontroller. It is unoptimized but can be used to explain the basics of sound-processing with the Arduino. The in/out-put pins used on the microcontroller should be self explanatory when following the code.
